__Game Of Life__
===============
> ### The game of life is a cellular automaton designed by British mathematician John Horton Conway.
> ### It is interesting because it is equivalent to a universal Turing machine, that is, everything that can be algorithmically computed can be computed in the game of life.
> ### Life has a variety of recognized patterns that come from certain starting positions.
> - Each cell has 8 "neighboring" cells.
> - Cells have two states: they are "alive" or "dead" (or "on" and "off").
> - The state of the cells evolves over discrete units of time (it could be said that in turns)    
> - All cells are updated simultaneously in each turn, following these rules:

__Rules__
---------------
    1.- A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighboring cells is """born""" (ie the next turn it will be alive).
    2.- A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighboring cells is still """alive""", otherwise it """dies""" (due to "loneliness" or "overpopulation").

__Cellular Automaton__
===============
> ### A cellular automaton (A.C.) is a mathematical model for a dynamic system that evolves in discrete steps.
> ### The main thrusters
> - Von Neumann 
> - John Horton Conway
> - Stephen Wolfram

__Patterns__
--------------- 
### __Rule 30__ Technically, this is chaos.
